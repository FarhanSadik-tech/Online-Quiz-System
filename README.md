# Project Description:
This Online Quiz System is a Java-based console application that simulates an interactive quiz environment for both administrators and quiz takers. The system allows an admin to create, manage, and delete quizzes, while users (students) can log in, attempt quizzes, and view their results. It uses OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction to maintain clean and scalable code.
